# WHAT DC/OS !!
# DC/OS (the datacenter operating system) is an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other.
# ok what DC/OS Marathon >>>> Deploy and manage applications to DC/OS.

# ok !! What Exploit !!
# Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create a 
  docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write 
  permissions on the host server that is running the docker container. 
  As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by 
  the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files 
  owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the 
  '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. *Notes: The docker image 
  must be a valid docker image from hub.docker.com. Further more the 
  docker container will only deploy if there are resources available 
  in the DC/OS cluster
